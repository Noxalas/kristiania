# Universal Layering

A universal layering system consisting of 7 layers for use in my game projects.

Layers top to bottom:
- [[Effects]] (Weather & other)
- [[Foreground]]
- [[Foreground props]]
- [[Geometry]]
- [[Background props]]
- [[Background tiles]]
- [[Parallax Background]]

The switching of layers could be done by scrolling on top of a small rotor-like UI element. Scrolling on top of it would switch layers and display the name of the current layer.
