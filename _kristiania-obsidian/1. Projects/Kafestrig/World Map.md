## Difference Between Coop and Singleplayer
### Coop
The map only displays over a player's head in a 3x3 grid. If multiple players choose to open the map at the same time, the map size will grow by 3x3 blocks for each player that joins, making the maximum size 6x6.

### Singleplayer
Immediately shows a fullscreen map, fading the background a bit to focus in on it.
