Idea:
	A system that lets the player pause the game at any time, and using a magnifying glass, can 'inspect' elements on the screen. The more they've discovered about a certain enemy or object, the more information is shown.

What it solves:
	This system reduces the amount of information on-screen, makes memorization of stats a little less important, and helps with accessibility.
