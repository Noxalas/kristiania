# Kafestrig

*Kafestrig is a game designed by Nataniel Wlosek & Martine Brekke Karlengen*

The game is supposed to be a merging of roguelite and management, where you go out on expeditions, gather resources and come back to a distillery where you sell drinks and food to customers.

Inspired by the concept of Moonlighter.
