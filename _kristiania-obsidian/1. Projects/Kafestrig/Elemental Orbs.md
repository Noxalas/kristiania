*Orbs are one of the main forms in which elements appear in the world.*

These orbs usually contain a single type of element, and have a certain level of concentration. The size isn't an indicator of the amount of essence, but rather of the concentration itself. (The smaller the orb, the more dangerous an explosion would be)

Orbs can also cause [[Elemental Reactions|elemental reactions]] when explosions overlap, or an explosion is in range of an object afflicted by another element's effect. Since they are only segments of their usual form, [[Irdh]], it's a lot more challenging to put them back together. Some elements cancel eachother out, or even cause extremely unstable effects.
