An external level editor that makes it easier to produce levels for all my Godot projects.

Inspired by LDtk, this editor also takes advantage of a [[World view]] with individual levels shown.

Using the [[Universal Layering]] I can have a simple way to create functionally and aesthetically sound screens.

The level editor has all the [[Hotkeys]] you would need for an efficient workflow.
